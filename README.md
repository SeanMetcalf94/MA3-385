# MA3-385

This program uses a dataset containing information about the rivers in New Zealand.

The program takes the first 500 values(of 600,000) for upper X, lower X, upper Y, and lower Y values and maps them to the screen.
The program also generates one square oscillator per 20 "rivers", gradually creating a wall of noise over time.

That's it!
